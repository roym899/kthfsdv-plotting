# kthfsdv-plotting

## Summary / Goal
Goal of this project is to visualize a specified function.
The time aspect of the function will be realized as a parameter t inside the 
function. 

In addition the goal is to analyze the given function and automatically adjust the plot for detected
periodicity such that only one period of the function is plotted.

Packages used

- pyqt4 for providing a user interface
- pyqtgraph for priving the plotting since it is made for real time plotting
- numpy for storing and manipulating the data

## TODO / Outline

- [X] Basic user interface
- [X] Basic plotting widget
- [ ] Manual axis scaling
- [ ] Manual periodicity setting
- [X] Real time plotting
- [ ] Support for general functions
- [ ] Automatic periodicity analysis
- [ ] Multi function support
